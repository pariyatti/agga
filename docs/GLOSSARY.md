# Glossary: Pariyatti Mobile App

Please use this document to define terms specific to the domain of the Pariyatti Mobile App. "Domain" in this context refers to Domain-Driven Design with an explicit focus on [Ubiquitous Language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html). The terms defined in the Glossary should be used and understood by users, designers, developers, and testers _ubiquitously_.

As we come across new terms or adjust old terms, please define and re-define them here. If you are new to the Pariyatti app team, please read this document before contributing.


## In Alphabetical Order:

- **Account**: The "Account" **section** contains the currently logged-in user's account information, such as whether or not they are an old student.

- **card**: A key UI component in the mobile app, items in the "Today" **tab** will be grouped into "cards" similar in physical appearance to a recipe card.

- **Donate**: The "Donate" **section** contains an online payment form the user may use to make a donation to the Pariyatti 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. This **tab**/**section** may or may not be included in the first version of the app.

- **Offerings**: The "Offerings" **section** contains information on Pali Study and Pilgrimages. This **tab**/**section** will be unavailable in the first version of the app.

- **pariyatti**: The Pali word for "theory" in the sense of Dhamma, as taught intellectually, through literature. Also the name of the [501(c)(3) US-based non-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pariyatti).

- **prototype**: Semantically similar to "spike" but with the intention of keeping the output and iterating on it. A prototype can be thought of as a spike that has graduated to a point where users will get involved in experimentation.

- **Resources**: The "Resources" **section** contains searchable books, audio, and videos as both online content and physical media for sale through the [Pariyatti Store](https://store.pariyatti.org/).

- **section**: A group of information available through the app by clicking one of the five **tabs** at the bottom of the screen.

- **spike**: Traditionally an experimental sample of a proposed application, running from the user interface(s) to the back end processing and storage services. Semantically similar to "prototype" but a spike is usually thrown out rather than iterated on once it has proven useful. In our case, we might also "spike" experiments with different software frameworks or architecture before the actual development begins.

- **tab**: The five **sections** of the app ("Today", "Resources", "Offerings", "Account", "Donate") can be navigated to, from the bottom of the app, with clickable UI elements called "tabs".

- **Today**: The "Today" **section**, available from the "Today" **tab** at the bottom of the screen, displays an infinite scrolling UI of bite-sized content presented as **cards**.
