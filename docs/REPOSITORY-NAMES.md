# Repository Names

If we choose to continue with the current practice of naming git repositories with meaningful Pali words, 
we should follow some guidelines. Please choose words which meet these criteria:

- Pali meaning represents what the program does (if loosely)
- The word must be short (no compounds)
- The transliterated Latin spelling must not require any diacritics
    - One exception is if the word is a double-entendre and the second (or third) meaning uses diacritics. In this case, use the spelling _without_ diacritics.

## List

This list contains Pali words of (mostly) 4, 5, or 6 characters in Latin script. There are no diacritics. Some of the meanings will be useful for software projects.
