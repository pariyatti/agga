# agga [adj.]: _highest, top-most; first (in time)_

The Agga repo exists as a meta-repo for all other Pariyatti projects on GitHub. Treat this document as the hub of all other documentation for the Mobile App project. Please link to **all** documentation directly from this README.

## Statement of Purpose

[Pariyatti](https://www.pariyatti.org) has a large repository of texts, audio, and video available for free but currently lacks an effective mechanism for knowledge management and discovery. The Pariyatti Mobile App will serve to provide a broad spectrum of seekers access to this body of knowledge.

- [Call to Action: Pariyatti Open Source](https://github.com/pariyatti/agga/blob/master/docs/CALL-TO-ACTION.md) (We are looking for "Digital Dhamma Servers")

## Design Docs & Wireframes:
- [Mobile App](https://github.com/pariyatti/design/tree/master/mobile-app/renders)
- [Kosa Publisher](https://whimsical.com/JwhtJKYRasEaSk91s7nLuG)
- [Kosa Library](https://whimsical.com/5uyY3q9Pqv2iiWBbH29FfD)
- [All Other Designs](https://github.com/pariyatti/design)

## Architecture:
- [Kosa Architecture Decision Records](https://github.com/pariyatti/kosa/tree/master/docs/arch)
- [Pariyatti Network Topology](https://github.com/pariyatti/agga/blob/master/docs/network-topology.pdf)
- [The Pariyatti Data Model](https://github.com/pariyatti/agga/blob/master/docs/data-models.pdf)

## Architecture Background:
- [What is a (relational) database?](https://github.com/pariyatti/agga/blob/master/docs/what-is-a-relational-database.pdf)
- [What is a graph database?](https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-database/)
- The [WikiBase Architecture](https://addshore.com/2018/12/wikidata-architecture-overview-diagrams) is probably too complicated (for us).
- 2020-04 - Legacy Infrastructure: [Today](https://github.com/pariyatti/kosa/blob/master/docs/where-we-are-today.md) vs. [Tomorrow](https://github.com/pariyatti/kosa/blob/master/docs/where-we-are-tomorrow.md)

## Child Repositories

- [design](https://github.com/pariyatti/design) contains designs for all other projects.
- [kosa](https://github.com/pariyatti/kosa) is the library, editorial, and publishing service.
- [patta](https://github.com/pariyatti/patta) is the Pariyatti mobile app, written in Flutter.
- [pariyatti.app](https://github.com/pariyatti/pariyatti.app) contains the website for the Pariyatti App.

## Process

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pariyatti/agga/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before anything else.

The App has thus far followed a highly-distributed mode of discovery, design, project management, operations, and development. The existing [Pariyatti Staff](https://pariyatti.org/About#section4) will provide long-term guidance to the project. As such, a long-term view of the project must always be a priority for any contributor. Whenever decisions are made and design/development occurs, please keep in mind this question: "who will be responsible for this in 5 - 10 years?" Wherever and whenever possible, involve Pariyatti's long-term staff in discussions and ensure they have access to (and ultimate control of) all documents, code, accounts, passwords, keys, etc.

We will build the app and any corresponding server-side components as Free & Open Software. This is done for two reasons: (1) ethical software practices, in the interest of strengthening sila throughout the project and (2) smooth collaboration between various volunteers/servers/staff with different levels of commitment.
