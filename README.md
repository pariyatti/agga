## Statement of Purpose

[Pariyatti](https://www.pariyatti.org) has a large repository of texts, audio, and video available for free but currently lacks an effective mechanism for knowledge management and discovery. The Pariyatti Mobile App will serve to provide a broad spectrum of seekers access to this body of knowledge.


## Process

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Pariyatti-apps/pariyatti-mobile-app-spike/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

The App has thus far followed a highly-distributed mode of discovery, design, project management, operations, and development. The existing [Pariyatti Staff](https://pariyatti.org/About#section4) will provide long-term guidance to the project. As such, a long-term view of the project must always be a priority for any contributor. Whenever decisions are made and design/development occurs, please keep in mind this question: "who will be responsible for this in 5 - 10 years?" Wherever and whenever possible, involve Pariyatti's long-term staff in discussions and ensure they have access to (and ultimate control of) all documents, code, accounts, passwords, keys, etc.

We will build the app and any corresponding server-side components as Free & Open Software. This is done for two reasons: (1) ethical software practices, in the interest of strengthening sila throughout the project and (2) smooth collaboration between various volunteers/servers/staff with different levels of commitment.
